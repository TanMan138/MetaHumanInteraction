# MetaHumanInteraction
 This project showcases an interactive 3D environment featuring a virtual human that dynamically responds to user gaze. The virtual character tracks the user's head and eye movement, ensuring realistic eye contact and alignment of head, neck, and body. Designed for walk-by interactions, the simulation adjusts for user height, creating a natural and immersive experience.
